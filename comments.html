        <p>I think JavaScript is an amazing language I love the ability to make somethin dynamic where it reduces the amount of coding and replicating needed to do across files. I do not think its easy at all understanding the differences between attributes, Event handlers, Event Listener but once you understand them or at least start using them more frequently it becomes more normal. Getting used to the console and understanding the document object model is really key. but you don't need to understand everyou just need to know how to pull from it specifically to tap into html elements, styling and great for changing images with grabbing src's. If you understand how to dig file folders or how to grab deep children from parent tags in css its highly similiar to it, so getting used to it makes life a bit easier.</p>
